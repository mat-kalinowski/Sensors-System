# About Project

Project ordered by client. System for controlling digital sensors counting products on conveyor belt:
- <strong>Python IoT server</strong> managing MQTT communication with sensors and communicating through RabbitMQ with main C# backend.
- <strong>Digital Sensors</strong> made with NodeMCU board and electrical components - capacitors, movement sensors and resistors.
- <strong>FreeRTOS firmware</strong> containing communication logic and managing counting functionality.
- <strong>C# Backend and React Frontend</strong> written to store and display data about given work stations. <i>(Only dummy backend included in this repo)</i>
